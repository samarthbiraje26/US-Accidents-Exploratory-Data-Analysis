This project is based on my internship at Infosys Springboard.

The goal of this project is to analyze a large dataset of road accidents to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to accident severity. The project involves performing in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract meaningful insights that can help improve road safety.

Outcomes:

- Understand how to handle and preprocess real-world accident data.- Explore accident frequency based on time, location, weather, and road conditions.- Visualize patterns in accident severity using various plots and graphs.- Derive insights to support road safety awareness and policy recommendations.- Prepare detailed documentation and presentation of their indings and results.

Dataset:

US Accidents Dataset (from Kaggle):https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents The dataset includes over 4 million accident records with attributes such as time, location, severity, weather, road conditions, and visibility.
